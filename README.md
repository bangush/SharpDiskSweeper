# Sharp Disk Sweeper

Sharp Disk Sweeper is a very useful tool to help reveal outstanding huge files/folders that are eating up your disk space the most. The idea is inspired by the popular macOS app [OmniDiskSweeper](https://www.omnigroup.com/more/).

Sharp Disk Sweeper is written in C# and WPF. The project is a great example for developers who want to learn WPF and XAML, especially on how to customize standard controls using styles and templates. The project also demonstrates how to start/cancel background tasks with `async` and `await` effectively with the UI still responsive.
