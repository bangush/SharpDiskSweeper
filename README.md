# Sharp Disk Sweeper

Sharp Disk Sweeper is a very useful tool that helps reveal outstanding huge files/folders that are eating up your disk space the most. The idea is inspired by the popular macOS app [OmniDiskSweeper](https://www.omnigroup.com/more/).

Sharp Disk Sweeper is written in C# and WPF. The project is a great example for developers who want to learn WPF and XAML, especially on how to customize the look and feel of standard controls using styles and templates. The project also demonstrates how to effectively start/cancel background tasks with `async` and `await` with the UI still responsive.
